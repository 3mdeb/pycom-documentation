# Installing Pycom Software

To get you up and running, Pycom provides a suite of tools to assist with developing and programming your Pycom Devices. To get started, you'll need to update the firmware on your board. This can be done with the Pycom Firmware Update Tool.

{% hint style='info' %}
It is strongly recommended to **update the firmware** on your board before starting to code. Pycom aims to have the latest and most stable firmware builds and frequently pushes new firmware to its devices. To ensure that you have the most stable build of firmware, please regularly check for firmware updates. The update procedure is described in [Firmware Upgrades](installation/firmwaretool.md).

# class pycom â€“ Pycom Device Features
The pycom module contains functions to control specific features of the pycom devices, such as the heartbeat RGB LED.

### Quick Usage Example

```python
import pycom

pycom.heartbeat(False)  # disable the heartbeat LED
pycom.heartbeat(True)   # enable the heartbeat LED
pycom.heartbeat()       # get the heartbeat state
pycom.rgbled(0xff00)    # make the LED light up in green color
```

### Functions

<function>pycom.heartbeat([enable])</function>

Get or set the state (enabled or disabled) of the heartbeat LED. Accepts and returns boolean values (True or False).

<function>pycom.rgbled(color)</function>

Set the colour of the RGB LED. The color is specified as 24 bit value representing red, green and blue, where the red colour is represented by the 8 most significant bits. For instance, passing the value ``0x00FF00`` will light up the LED in a very bright green.

Documentation\nWelcome to the Pycom documentation site. The documentation is split into 5 sections; we recommend reading through all the sections to familiarise yourself with the various tools and features available to you to help you develop on your Pycom module.\n\n\nAll the new Pycom modules are based on the same ESP32 chip and therefore share similar schematics, pinouts & firmware. Majority of the documentation is applicable for all Pycom devices, with separate sections for tutorials and firmware references.\nTo get started, read through the Quickstart Guide then feel free to jump straight into the tutorials and examples in Tutorials & Examples to begin building your projects.\n"},"chapter/products.html":{"url":"chapter/products.html","title":"Pycom Products","keywords":"","body":"Pycom Products\nDevelopment Devices\nOEM Devices\nExpansion Boards\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/","title":"1.1 Introduction","keywords":"","body":"\n\nGetting Started\nLet’s start with a quick description of what to do after you unpack your brand new Pycom Device. The aim of this guide is not to bug you with complex details about it, but instead get you up and running as quickly as possible!\nThis chapter help you with the unboxing of and getting started with your device. If you come across any issues along the way, there is a Troubleshooting section that addresses the common problems. In case you can not find the answer to your issue, you can always ask questions in our Forum.\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/unboxing.html":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/unboxing.html","title":"1.2 Unboxing/Setup","keywords":"","body":"Unboxing & Setup (Expansion Board)\nLets get started setting up the Pycom device. The easiest method to programming/using a Pycom device is with the Expansion Board. To start, connect the module to the Expansion Board:\n\nLook for the reset button on the module (located at a corner of the board, next to the LED).\nLocate the USB connector on the expansion board.\nInsert the module on the expansion board with the reset button pointing towards the USB connector. It should firmly click into place and the pins should now no longer be visible.\nIt’s that simple! For confirmation, here’s a picture demonstrating how to correctly align a Pycom device with the expansion board:\n\n\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\nSome devices, such as the LoPy, will cover the USB connector. This is normal; remember to keep the orientation as shown in the image above.\n\nLooking After Your Device\nTo ensure the longevity of your expansion board, please be aware of the following:\n\nBe gentle when plugging/unplugging the USB cable. Whilst the USB connector is soldered and relatively strong, it can break off and is be difficult to fix.\nStatic electricity can damage components on the board and may destroy them. If there is a lot of static electricity in the area (e.g. dry and cold climates), take extra care not to shock the device. If the device came in a ESD bag (Silver packaging), the best way to store and carry the device is inside this bag as it will be protected against static discharges.\n\nConnecting via USB\nOnce everything is in place, the device is ready to be programmed. Plug it into a USB socket (either to a computer or using an external battery).\nIn a few seconds, the LED should start blinking every 4 seconds. This means that everything is working correctly! If the LED is not blinking, please disconnect the power supply and re-check the board’s position on the expansion board.\n\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/installingsoftware.html":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/installingsoftware.html","title":"1.3 Installing Software","keywords":"","body":"Installing Pycom Software\nTo get you up and running, Pycom provides a suite of tools to assist with developing and programming your Pycom Devices. To get started, you'll need to update the firmware on your board. This can be done with the Pycom Firmware Update Tool.\nIt is strongly recommended to update the firmware on your board before starting to code. Pycom aims to have the latest and most stable firmware builds and frequently pushes new firmware to its devices. To ensure that you have the most stable build of firmware, please regularly check for firmware updates. The update procedure is described in Firmware Upgrades below.\n\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/installation/firmwaretool.html":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/installation/firmwaretool.html","title":"1.3.1 Updating Firmware","keywords":"","body":"Firmware Update Tools\nWe strongly recommend you to upgrade your firmware to the latest version as we are constantly making improvements and adding new features to the devices.\nHere are the download links to the update tool. Please download the appropriate one for your OS and follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nWindows\nMacOS (10.11 or Higher)\nLinux (requires dialog package)\n\nPrevious versions of firmware are available for download on the Pycom website.\n\nUpdating Device Firmware\nThe instructions given by the updater tool should be followed carefully. The basic procedure can be found below:\nIf you are having trouble connecting via USB, make sure you have the correct FTDI drivers installed.\n\n\nDisconnect your device from your computer\nConnect a jumper cable or wire between G23 and GND\nReconnect the board via USB to your computer\nRun the Firmware Upgrade tool\nRemove the G23 to GND jumper cable/wire\nReboot the device (button or power off then on)\nConnecting G23 and GND puts the device in ‘firmware update mode’. This mode is only used for updating the device’s firmware using the Firmware Update tool.\n\n\n\nAfter you’re done with upgrading, you can use the Pymakr Plugins to upload and run programs in your device.\nMake sure the TX jumper is present on your expansion board, as the jumpers sometimes come loose in the box during transport. Without this jumper, the updater will fail.\n\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/installation/pymakr.html":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/installation/pymakr.html","title":"1.3.2 Pymakr Plugin","keywords":"","body":"Using the Pymakr Plugin\nTo make it as easy as possible we developed a series of tools known as the Pymakr Plugins, which allow you to connect to and program your Pycom devices. These Plugins have been built for a number of text editors and IDEs to allow for users to choose their favourite development environment.\n\n\nExtended info about these Plugins, such as how to use the Pycom console and other features can be found under Tools & Features.\nPlease be aware that Pymakr IDE has been retired and that plugins for Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code & PyCharm are under development, with intention to replace Pymakr. Please read this forum post for more information.\n\nInstalling Pymakr Plugin (Atom)\nFor beginners, users getting started with MicroPython & Pycom as well as Atom text editor users, we recommend the Pymakr Plugin for Atom. This section will help you get started using the Atom Text Editor & Pymakr Plugin.\nPlease follow these steps to install the Pymakr Plugin:\n\nEnsure that you have Atom installed and open.\nNavigate to the Install page, via Atom > Preferences > Install\nSearch for Pymakr and select the official Pycom Pymakr Plugin.\nYou should now see and Install button. Click this to download and install the Pymakr Plugin.\nThat’s it! You’ve installed the Pymakr Plugin for Atom.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Configuration\nAfter installing the Pymakr Plugin, you need to take a few seconds to configure it for first time use. Please follow these steps:\n\nConnect your Pycom device to your computer via USB. Remove the wire between GND and G23, before plugging in your device, if you have just finished upgrading your firmware!\nOpen Atom and ensure that the Pymakr Plugin has correctly installed.\nIn the menu, go to Atom > Preferences > Packages > Pymakr. This may vary depending on your operating system!\nOpen the Pymakr console by clicking the 'Open' button, located in the lower right side of the Atom window.\nClick, 'More' followed by 'Get Serial Ports'.

This allows for much faster and more simple development process than using C.\n\n\nBooting into MicroPython\nWhen booting, two files are executed automatically: first boot.py and then main.py. These are placed in the /flash folder on the board. Any other files or libraries can be placed here as well, and can be included or used from boot.py or main.py.\nThe folder structure in /flash looks like the picture below. The files can be managed either using FTP or using the Pymakr Plugin.\n\n\nTips & Tricks\nMicropython shares majority of the same syntax as Python 3.5. The intention of this design is to provide compatibility upwards from Micropython to Python 3.5, meaning that code written for Micropython should work in a similar manner in Python 3.5. There are some minor variations and these should taken viewed as implementation differences.\nMicropython also has a number of Micropython specific libraries for accessing hardware level features. Specifics relating to those libraries can be found in the Firmware API Reference section of this documentation.\nMicropython, unlike C/C++ or Arduino, does not use braces {} to indicate blocks of code specified for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is strictly enforced.\nThe number of spaces in the indentation is variable but all statements within a block must be indented the same amount.\n\n"},"chapter/gettingstarted/micropython/examples.html":{"url":"chapter/gettingstarted/micropython/examples.html","title":"1.5.1 Examples","keywords":"","body":"MicroPython Examples\nTo get you started with Python (MicroPython) syntax, we've provided you with a number of code examples.\nVariable Assignment\nAs with Python 3.5, variables can be assigned to and referenced. Below is an example of setting a variable equal to a string and then printing it to the console.\nvariable = \"Hello World\"\nprint(variable)\n\nConditional Statements\nConditional statements allow control over which elements of code run depending on specific cases. The example below shows how a temperature sensor might be implemented in code.\ntemperature = 15\ntarget = 10\nif temperature > target:\n    print(\"Too High!\")\nelif temperature \nLoops (For & While loop)\nLoops are another important feature of any programming language. This allows you to cycle your code and repeat functions/assignments/etc.\nFor loops allow you to control how many times a block of code runs for within a range.\nx = 0\nfor y in range(0,9):\n    x += 1\nprint(x)\n\nWhile loops are similar to For loops, however they allow you to run a loop until a specific conditional is true/false. In this case, the loop checks if x is less than 9 each time the loop passes.\nx = 0\nwhile x \nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that are referred to by name. Data can be passed into it to be operated on (i.e., the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\nThe function below takes two numbers and adds them together, outputting the result.\ndef add(number1, number2):\n    return number1 + number2\n\nadd(1,2) # expect a result of 3\n\nThe next function takes an input name and returns a string containing a welcome phrase.\ndef welcome(name):\n    welcome_phrase = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n    print(welcome_phrase)\n\nwelcome(\"Alex\") # expect \"Hello, Alex!\"\n\nData Structures\nPython has a number of different data structures for storing and manipulating variables. The main difference (regarding data structures) between C and Python is that Python manages memory for you. This means there’s no need to declare the sizes of\nlists, dictionaries, strings, etc.\nLists\nA data structure that holds an ordered collection (sequence) of items.\nnetworks = ['lora', 'sigfox', 'wifi', 'bluetooth', 'lte-m']\nprint(network[2]) # expect 'wifi'\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary is like an address-book where you can find the address or contact details of a person by knowing only his/her name, i.e. keys (names) are associate with values (details).\naddress_book = {'Alex':'2604 Crosswind Drive','Joe':'1301 Hillview Drive','Chris':'3236 Goldleaf Lane'}\nprint(address_book['Alex']) # expect '2604 Crosswind Drive'\n\nTuple\nSimilar to lists but are  immutable, i.e. you cannot modify tuples after instantiation.\npycom_devices = ('wipy', 'lopy', 'sipy', 'gpy', 'fipy')\nprint(pycom_devices[0]) # expect 'wipy'\n\nFor more Python examples, check out these tutorials.

The usb serial address might also be listed as /dev/ttyUSB01 or a higher increment for ttyUSB. Additionally, the elevated permissions to access the device (eg group uucp/dialout or use sudo) may be required.\n\nWindows\nTo use the serial USB REPL with Windows, first ensure that the FTDI drivers are installed or install them from here. A terminal emulator is needed to open the connection from Windows; the easiest option is to download the free program, PuTTY.\nCOM Port\nTo use PuTTY the serial port (COM port) in which the Pycom device is connected, must be located.

This procedure also allows for the firmware to be reverted to earlier versions. A Pycom device can hold up to 3 different firmware versions; the factory firmware plus 2 OTA images.\nAfter reset, if P12 pin is held high, the heartbeat LED begin flashing orange slowly. If after 3 seconds the pin is still held high, the LED will start blinking faster and the device will select the previous OTA image to boot. If this image is the desired firmware, P12 must be released before 3 more seconds elapse. If an additional 3 seconds later, the pin is still high, the factory firmware will be selected. The LED will then flash quickly for another 1.5 seconds and the device will then proceed to boot. The firmware selection mechanism is as follows:\nSafe Boot\nPin P12 released during:\n\n\n\n1st 3 secs window\n2nd 3 secs window\nFinal 1.5 secs window\n\n\n\n\nlatest firmware\nprevious firmware\nfactory firmware\n\n\n\nWith all of the 3 above scenarios, safe boot mode is entered. This means that the execution of both boot.py and main.py is skipped. This may be useful to recover from crash situations produced by the user scripts. The selection made during safe boot is not persistent, therefore after the next normal reset, the latest firmware will proceed to run again.\nIf problems occur within the filesystem, the user may wish to format the internal flash drive.\nReset\nPycom devices support both soft and hard resets. A soft reset clears the state of the MicroPython virtual machine but leaves hardware peripherals unaffected. To do a soft reset, press Ctrl+D on the REPL or from within a script, run:\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.exit()\n\nA hard reset is the same as performing a power cycle to the device. In order to hard reset the device, press the reset switch or run:\n>>> import machine\n>>> machine.reset()\n\nFactory Reset the Filesystem\nIf a device’s filesystem gets corrupted, it can format it by running:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.mkfs('/flash')\n\nBe aware, resetting the flash filesystem will delete all files inside the internal device storage (not the SD card) and restores the files boot.py and main.py to their factory states after the next reset.\n\n"},"chapter/toolsandfeatures/notes.html":{"url":"chapter/toolsandfeatures/notes.html","title":"2.6 Notes","keywords":"","body":"Notes\nInterrupt Handling\nIn Pycom’s ESP32 MicroPython port there are no restrictions on what can be done within an interrupt handler. For example, other ports do not allow allocating memory inside the handler or the use of sockets.\nThese limitations were raised by handling the interrupt events differently. When an interrupt happens, a message is posted into a queue, notifying a separate thread that the appropriate callback handler should be called. Such handler would receive an argument. By default it is the object associated with the event.\nThe user can do whatever is required inside of the callback, such as creating new variables, or even sending network packets. Bear in mind that interrupts are processed sequentially and thus it is ideal to keep the handlers as short as possible in order to attend all of them in the minimum time.\nCurrently, there are 2 classes that support interrupts; the Alarm and Pin classes. Both classes provide the .callback() method that enables the interrupt and registers the given handler.

These libraries reside at the Pycom GitHub repository and the latest versions can be found under the releases page.\nGitHub Repository\nDownload the repository as a .zip file, navigate to the correct device (Pysense/Pytrack), extract the files and then upload the desired files to the device in the instructions below.\nUploading the Libraries to a Device\nThese libraries should be uploaded to a device (LoPy, SiPy, WiPy 2.0, etc.) in the same process as a standard MicroPython library. The various .py files should be placed into the /lib folder on the device. For example, if using the Pysense and the user wishes to enable the only Accelerometer and the Light Sensor, they should place the following .py files into the device's /lib folder:\n\npysense.py\nLIS2HH12.py\nLTR329ALS01.py\n\nAdd as many or as few of the libraries that are required.\nThe Pytrack and Pysense boards behave the same as the Expansion Board. Sync, Run and upload code to Pycom modules via the Pymakr Plugin, in exactly the same process.\n\nImporting/Using the Libraries\nOnce the libraries are uploaded to the device, they can be used/imported as a typical MicroPython library would be. For example, importing and using the light sensor on the Pysense:\nfrom pysense import Pysense\nfrom LTR329ALS01 import LTR329ALS01\n\npy = Pysense()\nlt = LTR329ALS01(py)\n\nprint(lt.light())\n\n"},"chapter/pytrackpysense/apireference/":{"url":"chapter/pytrackpysense/apireference/","title":"4.3 API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API Reference\nTo simplify usability, APIs for the libraries have been created, abstracting away the low level interactions with the sensors.

Upon connecting, there should be a blank screen with a flashing cursor. Press Enter and a MicroPython prompt should appear, i.e. >>>. Let’s make sure it is working with the obligatory test:\n>>> print(\"Hello LoPy!\")\nHello LoPy!\n\nIn the example above, the >>> characters should not be typed. They are there to indicate that the text should be placed after the prompt. Once the text has been entered print(\"Hello LoPy!\") and pressed Enter, the output should appear on screen, identical to the example above.\nBasic Python commands can be tested out in a similar fashion.\nIf this is not working, try either a hard reset or a soft reset; see below.\nHere are some other example, utilising the device's hardware features:\n>>> from machine import Pin\n>>> led = Pin('G16', mode=Pin.OUT, value=1)\n>>> led(0)\n>>> led(1)\n>>> led.toggle()\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n>>> 5 / 2\n2.5\n>>> 20 * 'py'\n'pypypypypypypypypypypypypypypypypypypypy'\n\nResetting the Device\nIf something goes wrong, the device can be reset with two methods. The first is to press CTRL-D at the MicroPython prompt, which will perform a soft reset. A message, as following, will appear:\n>>>\nPYB: soft reboot\nMicroPython v1.4.6-146-g1d8b5e5 on 2016-10-21; LoPy with ESP32\nType \"help()\" for more information.\n>>>\n\nIf that still isn’t working a hard reset can be performed (power-off/on) by pressing the RST switch (the small black button next to the RGB LED).

LoRa can work in 2 different modes; LoRa-MAC (which we also call Raw-LoRa) and LoRaWAN mode.\nLoRa-MAC mode basically accesses de radio directly and packets are sent using the LoRa modulation on the selected frequency without any headers, addressing information or encryption. Only a CRC is added at the tail of the packet and this is removed before the received frame is passed on to the application. This mode can be used to build any higher level protocol that can benefit from the long range features of the LoRa modulation. Typical uses cases include LoPy to LoPy direct communication and a LoRa packet forwarder.\nLoRaWAN mode implements the full LoRaWAN stack for a class A device. It supports both OTAA and ABP connection methods, as well as advanced features like adding and removing custom channels to support “special” frequencies plans like the those used in New Zealand.\n"},"chapter/tutorials/lopy/lora-mac.html":{"url":"chapter/tutorials/lopy/lora-mac.html","title":"5.3.1 LoRa-MAC (Raw LoRa)","keywords":"","body":"LoRa-MAC (Raw LoRa)\nBasic LoRa connection example, sending and receiving data.

Enter a username and an email address to verify with their platform.\n\n\nOnce an account has been registered, the nano-gateway can then be registered. To do this, navigate to the TTN Console web page.\nRegistering the Gateway\nInside the TTN Console, there are two options, applications and gateways. Select gateways and then click on register gateway. This will allow for the set up and registration of a new nano-gateway.\n\n\nOn the Register Gateway page, you will need to set the following settings:\n\n\nThese are unique to each gateway, location and country specific frequency. Please verify that correct settings are selected otherwise the gateway will not connect to TTN.\n\n\n\nOption\nValue\n\n\n\n\nProtocol\nPacket Forwarder\n\n\nGateway EUI\nUser Defined (must match config.py)\n\n\nDescription\nUser Defined\n\n\nFrequency Plan\nSelect Country (e.g. EU - 868 MHz)\n\n\nLocation\nUser Defined\n\n\nAntenna Placement\nIndoor or Outdoor\n\n\n\nOnce these settings have been applied, click Register Gateway. A Gateway Overview page will appear, with the configuration settings showing. Next click on the Gateway Settings and configure the Router address to match that of the gateway (default - router.eu.thethings.network).\n\n\nThe Gateway should now be configured. Next one or more nodes can now be configured to use the nano-gateway and TTN applications may be built.\nLoPy Node\nThere are two methods of connecting LoPy devices to the nano-gateway, Over the Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation By Personalisation (ABP). The code and instructions for registering these methods are shown below, followed by instruction for how to connect them to an application on TTN.\nIt’s important that the following code examples (also on GitHub) are used to connect to the nano-gateway as it only supports single channel connections.\n\nOTAA (Over The Air Activation)\nWhen the LoPy connects an application (via TTN) using OTAA, the network configuration is derived automatically during a handshake between the LoPy and network server. Note that the network keys derived using the OTAA methodology are specific to the device and are used to encrypt and verify transmissions at the network level.\n\"\"\" OTAA Node example compatible with the LoPy Nano Gateway \"\"\"\n\nfrom network import LoRa\nimport socket\nimport binascii\nimport struct\nimport time\n\n# Initialize LoRa in LORAWAN mode.\nlora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN)\n\n# create an OTA authentication params\ndev_eui = binascii.unhexlify('AA BB CC DD EE FF 77 78'.replace(' ','')) # these settings can be found from TTN\napp_eui = binascii.unhexlify('70 B3 D5 7E F0 00 3B FD'.replace(' ','')) # these settings can be found from TTN\napp_key = binascii.unhexlify('36 AB 76 25 FE 77 77 68 81 68 3B 49 53 00 FF D6'.replace(' ','')) # these settings can be found from TTN\n\n# set the 3 default channels to the same frequency (must be before sending the OTAA join request)\nlora.add_channel(0, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\nlora.add_channel(1, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\nlora.add_channel(2, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\n\n# join a network using OTAA\nlora.join(activation=LoRa.OTAA, auth=(dev_eui, app_eui, app_key), timeout=0)\n\n# wait until the module has joined the network\nwhile not lora.has_joined():\n    time.sleep(2.5)\n    print('Not joined yet...')\n\n# remove all the non-default channels\nfor i in range(3, 16):\n    lora.remove_channel(i)\n\n# create a LoRa socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# set the LoRaWAN data rate\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 5)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(False)\n\ntime.sleep(5.0)\n\n\"\"\" Your own code can be written below! \"\"\"\n\nfor i in range (200):\n    s.send(b'PKT #' + bytes([i]))\n    time.sleep(4)\n    rx = s.recv(256)\n    if rx:\n        print(rx)\n    time.sleep(6)\n\nABP (Activation By Personalisation)\nUsing ABP join mode requires the user to define the following values and input them into both the LoPy and the TTN Application:\n\nDevice Address\nApplication Session Key\nNetwork Session Key\n\n\"\"\" ABP Node example compatible with the LoPy Nano Gateway \"\"\"\n\nfrom network import LoRa\nimport socket\nimport binascii\nimport struct\nimport time\n\n# Initialize LoRa in LORAWAN mode.\nlora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN)\n\n# create an ABP authentication params\ndev_addr = struct.unpack(\">l\", binascii.unhexlify('26 01 14 7D'.replace(' ','')))[0] # these settings can be found from TTN\nnwk_swkey = binascii.unhexlify('3C74F4F40CAE2221303BC24284FCF3AF'.replace(' ','')) # these settings can be found from TTN\napp_swkey = binascii.unhexlify('0FFA7072CC6FF69A102A0F39BEB0880F'.replace(' ','')) # these settings can be found from TTN\n\n# join a network using ABP (Activation By Personalization)\nlora.join(activation=LoRa.ABP, auth=(dev_addr, nwk_swkey, app_swkey))\n\n# remove all the non-default channels\nfor i in range(3, 16):\n    lora.remove_channel(i)\n\n# set the 3 default channels to the same frequency\nlora.add_channel(0, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\nlora.add_channel(1, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\nlora.add_channel(2, frequency=868100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=5)\n\n# create a LoRa socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# set the LoRaWAN data rate\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 5)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(False)\n\n\"\"\" Your own code can be written below! \"\"\"\n\nfor i in range (200):\n    s.send(b'PKT #' + bytes([i]))\n    time.sleep(4)\n    rx = s.recv(256)\n    if rx:\n        print(rx)\n    time.sleep(6)\n\nTTN Applications\nNow that the gateway & nodes have been setup, a TTN Application can be built; i.e. what happens to the LoRa data once it is received by TTN. There are a number of different setups/systems that can be used, however the following example demonstrates the HTTP request integration.\nRegistering an Application\nSelecting the Applications tab at the top of the TTN console, will bring up a screen for registering applications. Click register and a new page, similar to the one below, will open.\n\n\nEnter a unique Application ID as well as a Description & Handler Registration.\nNow the LoPy nodes must be registered to send data up to the new Application.\nRegistering Devices (LoPy)\nTo connect nodes to the nano-gateway, devices need to be added to the application. To do this, navigate to the Devices tab on the Application home page and click the Register Device button.\n\n\nIn the Register Device panel, complete the forms for the Device ID and the Device EUI. The Device ID is user specified and is unique to the device in this application. The Device EUI is also user specified but must consist of exactly 8 bytes, given in hexadecimal.\nOnce the device has been added, change the Activation Method between OTAA and ABP depending on user preference. This option can be found under the Settings tab.\nAdding Application Integrations\nNow that the data is arriving on the TTN Backend, TTN can be managed as to where data should be delivered to. To do this, use the Integrations tab within the new Application’s settings.\n\n\nUpon clicking add integration, a screen with 4 different options will appear. These have various functionality and more information about them can be found on the TTN website/documentation.\nFor this example, use the HTTP Integration to forward the LoRaWAN Packets to a remote server/address.\n\n\nClick HTTP Integration to connect up an endpoint that can receive the data.\nFor testing, a website called RequestBin may be used to receive the data that TTN forwards (via POST Request). To set this up, navigate to RequestBin and click the Create a RequestBin.\n\n\nCopy the URL that is generated and past this into the URL form under the Application Settings.\n\n\nThis is the address that TTN will forward data onto. As soon as a LoPy starts sending messages, TTN will forward these onto RequestBin and they will appear at the unique RequestBin URL.\n"},"chapter/tutorials/sipy/":{"url":"chapter/tutorials/sipy/","title":"5.4 SiPy Examples","keywords":"","body":"SiPy Tutorials\nTo ensure your device has been provisioned with Device ID and PAC number, please update to the latest firmware.\nThe following tutorials demonstrate how to register and get started with the SiPy.

However, MicroPython is highly configurable, and each port to a particular board/embedded system makes available only a subset of MicroPython libraries. For officially supported ports, there is an effort to either filter out non-applicable items, or mark individual descriptions with “Availability:” clauses describing which ports provide a given feature. With that in mind, please still be warned that some functions/classes in a module (or even the entire module) described in this documentation may be unavailable in a particular build of MicroPython on a particular board. The best place to find general information of the availability/non-availability of a particular feature is the “General Information” section which contains information pertaining to a specific port.\nBeyond the built-in libraries described in this documentation, many more modules from the Python standard library, as well as further MicroPython extensions to it, can be found in the micropython-lib repository.\n"},"chapter/firmwareapi/pycom/":{"url":"chapter/firmwareapi/pycom/","title":"6.2 Pycom Modules","keywords":"","body":"Pycom Modules\nThese modules are specific to the Pycom devices and may have slightly different implementations to other variations of MicroPython (i.e. for Non-Pycom devices).

See constants for the possible return values.\nInterrupt Functions\nmachine.disable_irq()\n\nDisable interrupt requests. Returns and integer representing the previous IRQ state. This return value can be passed to enable_irq to restore the IRQ to its original state.\nmachine.enable_irq([state])\n\nEnable interrupt requests. The most common use of this function is to pass the value returned by disable_irq to exit a critical section. Another options is to enable all interrupts which can be achieved by calling the function with no parameters.\nPower Functions\nmachine.freq()\n\nReturns CPU frequency in hertz.\nmachine.idle()\n\nGates the clock to the CPU, useful to reduce power consumption at any time during short or long periods. Peripherals continue working and execution resumes as soon as any interrupt is triggered (on many ports this includes system timer interrupt occurring at regular intervals on the order of millisecond).\nmachine.deepsleep([time_ms])\n\nStops the CPU and all peripherals (including networking interfaces, if any). Execution is resumed from the main script, just as with a reset. If a value in milliseconds is given then the device will wake up after that period of time, otherwise it will remain in deep sleep until the reset button is pressed.\nmachine.pin_deepsleep_wakeup(pins, mode, enable_pull)\n\nConfigure pins to wake up from deep sleep mode. The pins which have this capability are: P2, P3, P4, P6, P8 to P10 and P13 to P23.\nThe arguments are:\n\npins a list or tuple containing the GPIO to setup for deepsleep wakeup.\nmode selects the way the configure GPIOs can wake up the module. The possible values are: machine.WAKEUP_ALL_LOW and machine.WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH.\nenable_pull if set to True keeps the pull up or pull down resistors enabled during deep sleep. If this variable is set to True, then ULP or capactive touch wakeup cannot be used in combination with GPIO wakeup.\n\nmachine.wake_reason()\n\nGet the wake reason. See constants for the possible return values. Returns a tuple of the form: (wake_reason, gpio_list). When the wakeup reason is either GPIO or touch pad, then the second element of the tuple is a list with GPIOs that generated the wakeup.\nMiscellaneous Functions\nmachine.main(filename)\n\nSet the filename of the main script to run after boot.py is finished. If this function is not called then the default file main.py will be executed.\nIt only makes sense to call this function from within boot.py.\nmachine.rng()\n\nReturn a 24-bit software generated random number.\nmachine.unique_id()\n\nReturns a byte string with a unique identifier of a board/SoC. It will vary from a board/SoC instance to another, if underlying hardware allows. Length varies by hardware (so use substring of a full value if you expect a short ID).

BLE uses a methodology known as Generic Access Profile (GAP) to control connections and advertising.\nGAP allows for devices to take various roles but generic flow works with devices that are either a Server (low power, resource constrained, sending small payloads of data) or a Client device (commonly a mobile device, PC or Pycom Device with large resources and processing power). Pycom devices can act as both a Client and a Server.\nConstructors\nclass network.Bluetooth(id=0, ...)\n\nCreate a Bluetooth object, and optionally configure it. See init for params of configuration.\nExample:\nfrom network import Bluetooth\nbluetooth = Bluetooth()\n\nMethods\nbluetooth.init()\n\nInitialises and enables the Bluetooth radio in BLE mode.\nbluetooth.deinit()\n\nDisables the Bluetooth radio.\nbluetooth.start_scan(timeout)\n\nStarts performing a scan listening for BLE devices sending advertisements. This function always returns immediately, the scanning will be performed on the background. The return value is None. After starting the scan the function get_adv() can be used to retrieve the advertisements messages from the FIFO. The internal FIFO has space to cache 8 advertisements.\nThe arguments are:\n\ntimeout specifies the amount of time in seconds to scan for advertisements, cannot be zero. If timeout is > 0, then the BLE radio will listen for advertisements until the specified value in seconds elapses. If timeout stop_scan() needs to be called to cancel the scanning process.\n\nExamples:\nbluetooth.start_scan(10)        # starts scanning and stop after 10 seconds\nbluetooth.start_scan(-1)        # starts scanning indefenitely until bluetooth.stop_scan() is called\n\nbluetooth.stop_scan()\n\nStops an ongoing scanning process. Returns None.\nbluetooth.isscanning()\n\nReturns True if a Bluetooth scan is in progress. False otherwise.\nbluetooth.get_adv()\n\nGets an named tuple with the advertisement data received during the scanning. The tuple has the following structure: (mac, addr_type, adv_type, rssi, data)\n\nmac is the 6-byte ling mac address of the device that sent the advertisement.\naddr_type is the address type. See the constants section below for more details.\nadv_type is the advertisement type received. See the constants section below fro more details.\nrssi is signed integer with the signal strength of the advertisement.\ndata contains the complete 31 bytes of the advertisement message. In order to parse the data and get the specific types, the method resolve_adv_data() can be used.\n\nExample for getting mac address of an advertiser:\nimport binascii\n\nbluetooth = Bluetooth()\nbluetooth.start_scan(20) # scan for 20 seconds\n\nadv = bluetooth.get_adv() #\nbinascii.hexlify(adv.mac) # convert hexidecimal to ascii\n\nbluetooth.resolve_adv_data(data, data_type)\n\nParses the advertisement data and returns the requested data_type if present. If the data type is not present, the function returns None.\nArguments:\n\ndata is the bytes object with the complete advertisement data.\ndata_type is the data type to resolve from from the advertisement data. See constants section below for details.\n\nExample:\nimport binascii\nfrom network import Bluetooth\nbluetooth = Bluetooth()\n\nbluetooth.start_scan(20)\nwhile bluetooth.isscanning():\n    adv = bluetooth.get_adv()\n    if adv:\n        # try to get the complete name\n        print(bluetooth.resolve_adv_data(adv.data, Bluetooth.ADV_NAME_CMPL))\n\n        mfg_data = bluetooth.resolve_adv_data(adv.data, Bluetooth.ADV_MANUFACTURER_DATA)\n\n        if mfg_data:\n            # try to get the manufacturer data (Apple's iBeacon data is sent here)\n            print(binascii.hexlify(mfg_data))\n\nbluetooth.connect(mac_addr)\n\nOpens a BLE connection with the device specified by the mac_addr argument. This function blocks until the connection succeeds or fails. If the connections succeeds it returns a object of type GATTCConnection.\nbluetooth.connect('112233eeddff') # mac address is accepted as a string\n\nbluetooth.callback(trigger=None, handler=None, arg=None)\n\nCreates a callback that will be executed when any of the triggers occurs. The arguments are:\n\ntrigger can be either Bluetooth.NEW_ADV_EVENT, Bluetooth.CLIENT_CONNECTED or Bluetooth.CLIENT_DISCONNECTED\nhandler is the function that will be executed when the callback is triggered.\narg is the argument that gets passed to the callback. If nothing is given the bluetooth object itself is used.\n\nAn example of how this may be used can be seen in the bluetooth.events() method.\nbluetooth.events()\n\nReturns a value with bit flags identifying the events that have occurred since the last call. Calling this function clears the events.\nExample of usage:\nfrom network import Bluetooth\n\nbluetooth = Bluetooth()\nbluetooth.set_advertisement(name='LoPy', service_uuid=b'1234567890123456')\n\ndef conn_cb (bt_o):\n    events = bt_o.events()   # this method returns the flags and clears the internal registry\n    if events & Bluetooth.CLIENT_CONNECTED:\n        print(\"Client connected\")\n    elif events & Bluetooth.CLIENT_DISCONNECTED:\n        print(\"Client disconnected\")\n\nbluetooth.callback(trigger=Bluetooth.CLIENT_CONNECTED | Bluetooth.CLIENT_DISCONNECTED, handler=conn_cb)\n\nbluetooth.advertise(True)\n\nbluetooth.set_advertisement(* , name=None, manufacturer_data=None, service_data=None, service_uuid=None)\n\nConfigure the data to be sent while advertising. If left with the default of None the data won’t be part of the advertisement message.\nThe arguments are:\n\nname is the string name to be shown on advertisements.\nmanufacturer_data manufacturer data to be advertised (hint: use it for iBeacons).\nservice_data service data to be advertised.\nservice_uuid uuid of the service to be advertised.\n\nExample:\nbluetooth.set_advertisement(name=\"advert\", manufacturer_data=\"lopy_v1\")\n\nbluetooth.advertise([Enable])\nStart or stop sending advertisements. The set_advertisement() method must have been called prior to this one.\n\nbluetooth.service(uuid, * , isprimary=True, nbr_chars=1, start=True)\n\nCreate a new service on the internal GATT server.

In ALWAYS_ON mode, the radio is always listening for incoming - packets whenever a transmission is not taking place. In TX_ONLY the radio goes to sleep as soon as the transmission completes. In SLEEP mode the radio is sent to sleep permanently and won’t accept any commands until the power mode is changed.\ntx_iq enables TX IQ inversion.\nrx_iq enables RX IQ inversion.\nadr enables Adaptive Data Rate.\npublic selects between the public and private sync word.\ntx_retries sets the number of TX retries in LoRa.LORAWAN mode.\ndevice_class sets the LoRaWAN device class. Can be either LoRa.CLASS_A or LoRa.CLASS_C.\n\nIn LoRa.LORAWAN mode, only adr, public, tx_retries and device_class are used. All the other params will be ignored as they are handled by the LoRaWAN stack directly. On the other hand, in LoRa.LORA mode from those 3 arguments, only the public one is important in order to program the sync word. In LoRa.LORA mode adr, tx_retries and device_class are ignored since they are only relevant to the LoRaWAN stack.\n\nFor example, you can do:\n# initialize in raw LoRa mode\nlora.init(mode=LoRa.LORA, tx_power=14, sf=12)\n\nor:\n# initialize in LoRaWAN mode\nlora.init(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN)\n\nlora.join(activation, auth, * , timeout=None)\n\nJoin a LoRaWAN network. The parameters are:\n\nactivation: can be either LoRa.OTAA or LoRa.ABP.\nauth: is a tuple with the authentication data.\n\nIn the case of LoRa.OTAA the authentication tuple is: (app_eui, app_key).

The accepted values are: LoRa.ALWAYS_ON, LoRa.TX_ONLY and LoRa.SLEEP:\nlora.stats()\n\nReturn a named tuple with useful information from the last received LoRa or LoRaWAN packet. The named tuple has the following form:\n(rx_timestamp, rssi, snr, sftx, sfrx, tx_trials)\nExample:\nlora.stats()\n\nWhere:\n\nrx_timestamp is an internal timestamp of the last received packet with microseconds precision.\nrssi holds the received signal strength in dBm.\nsnr contains the signal to noise ratio id dB.\nsfrx tells the data rate (in the case of LORAWAN mode) or the spreading factor (in the case of LORA mode) of the last packet received.\nsftx tells the data rate (in the case of LORAWAN mode) or the spreading factor (in the case of LORA mode) of the last packet transmitted.\ntx_trials is the number of tx attempts of the last transmitted packet (only relevant for LORAWAN confirmed packets).\n\nlora.has_joined()\n\nReturns True if a LoRaWAN network has been joined. False otherwise.:\nlora.add_channel(index, * , frequency, dr_min, dr_max)\n\nAdd a LoRaWAN channel on the specified index. If there’s already a channel with that index it will be replaced with the new one.\nThe arguments are:\n\nindex: Index of the channel to add. Accepts values between 0 and 15 for EU and between 0 and 71 for US.\nfrequency: Centre frequency in Hz of the channel.\ndr_min: Minimum data rate of the channel (0-7).\ndr_max: Maximum data rate of the channel (0-7).\n\nExamples:\nlora.add_channel(index=0, frequency=868000000, dr_min=5, dr_max=6)\n\nlora.remove_channel(index)\n\nRemoves the channel from the specified index. On the 868MHz band the channels 0 to 2 cannot be removed, they can only be replaced by other channels using the lora.add_channel method. A way to remove all channels except for one is to add the same channel, 3 times on indexes 0, 1 and 2. An example can be seen below:\nlora.remove_channel()\n\nOn the 915MHz band there are no restrictions around this.\nlora.mac()\n\nReturns a byte object with the 8-Byte MAC address of the LoRa radio.\nlora.callback(trigger, handler=None, arg=None)\n\nSpecify a callback handler for the LoRa radio. The trigger types are LoRa.RX_PACKET_EVENT, LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT and LoRa.TX_FAILED_EVENT\nThe LoRa.RX_PACKET_EVENT event is raised for every received packet. The LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT event is raised as soon as the packet transmission cycle ends. In the case of non-confirmed transmissions, this will occur at the end of the receive windows, but, in the case of confirmed transmissions, this event will only be raised if the ack is received. If the ack is not received LoRa.TX_FAILED_EVENT will be raised after the number of tx_retries configured have been performed.\nAn example of how this callback functions can be seen the in method lora.events().\nlora.ischannel_free(rssi_threshold)\n\nThis method is used to check for radio activity on the current LoRa channel, and if the rssi of the measured activity is lower than the rssi_threshold given, the return value will be True, otherwise False. Example:\nlora.ischannel_free(-100)\n\nlora.set_battery_level(level)\n\nSet the battery level value that will be sent when the LoRaWAN MAC command that retrieves the battery level is received. This command is sent by the network and handled automatically by the LoRaWAN stack. Value should be in percentage, from 0 to 100. Values larger than 100 will be clipped:\nlora.set_battery_level(75)\n\nlora.events()\n\nThis method returns a value with bits sets (if any) indicating the events that have triggered the callback. Please note that by calling this function the internal events registry is cleared automatically, therefore calling it immediately for a second time will most likely return a value of 0.\nExample:\ndef lora_cb(lora):\n    events = lora.events()\n    if events & LoRa.RX_PACKET_EVENT:\n        print('Lora packet received')\n    if events & LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT:\n        print('Lora packet sent')\n\nlora.callback(trigger=(LoRa.RX_PACKET_EVENT | LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT), handler=lora_cb)\n\nConstants\nLoRa.LORA LoRa.LORAWAN\nLoRa stack mode\nLoRa.OTAA LoRa.ABP\nLoRaWAN join procedure\nLoRa.ALWAYS_ON LoRa.TX_ONLY LoRa.SLEEP\nRaw LoRa power mode\nLoRa.BW_125KHZ LoRa.BW_250KHZ LoRa.BW_500KHZ\nRaw LoRa bandwidth\nLoRa.CODING_4_5 LoRa.CODING_4_6 LoRa.CODING_4_7 LoRa.CODING_4_8\nRaw LoRa coding rate\nLoRa.RX_PACKET_EVENT LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT LoRa.TX_FAILED_EVENT\nCallback trigger types (may be ORed)\nLoRa.CLASS_A LoRa.CLASS_C\nLoRaWAN device class\nWorking with LoRa and LoRaWAN Sockets\nLoRa sockets are created in the following way:\nimport socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\nAnd they must be created after initialising the LoRa network card.\nLoRa sockets support the following standard methods from the socket module:\nsocket.close()\n\nUsage:\ns.close()\n\nsocket.bind(port_number)\n\nUsage:\ns.bind(1)\n\nThe bind() method is only applicable when the radio is configured in LoRa.LORAWAN mode.\n\nsocket.send(bytes)\n\nUsage:\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3]))\n\nor:\ns.send('Hello')\n\nsocket.recv(bufsize)\n\nUsage:\ns.recv(128)\n\nsocket.setsockopt(level, optname, value)\n\nSet the value of the given socket option.

The protocol is bi-directional, messages can both be sent up to and down from the Sigfox servers.\nWhen operating in RCZ2 and RCZ4 the module can only send messages on the default macro-channel (this is due to Sigfox network limitations). Therefore, the device needs to reset automatically to the default macro-channel after every 2 transmissions. However, due to FCC duty cycle limitations, there must a minimum of a 20s delay after resetting to the default macro-channel. Our API takes care of this, (and in real life applications you should not be in the need to send Sigfox messages that often), so it will wait for the necessary amount of time to make sure that the duty cycle restrictions are fulfilled.\nThis means that if you run a piece of test code like:\nfor i in range(1, 100):\n  # send something\n  s.send('Hello ' + str(i))\n\nThere will be a 20 second delay after every 2 packets.\n\nThis class provides a driver for the Sigfox network processor in the Sigfox enabled Pycom Devices.\nQuick Usage Example\nfrom network import Sigfox\nimport socket\n\n# init Sigfox for RCZ1 (Europe)\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1)\n\n# create a Sigfox socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(True)\n\n# configure it as uplink only\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, False)\n\n# send some bytes\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]))\n\nPlease ensure that there is an antenna connected to your device before sending/receiving Sigfox messages as in proper use (e.g. without an antenna), may damage the device.\n\nConstructors\nclass network.Sigfox(id=0, ...)\n\nCreate and configure a Sigfox object.

Sigfox.SIGFOX uses the Sigfox modulation and protocol while Sigfox.FSK allows to create point to point communication between 2 Devices using FSK modulation.\nrcz takes the following values: Sigfox.RCZ1, Sigfox.RCZ2, Sigfox.RCZ3, Sigfox.RCZ4. The rcz argument is only required if the mode is Sigfox.SIGFOX.\nfrequency sets the frequency value in FSK mode. Can take values between 863 and 928 MHz.\n\nThe SiPy comes in 2 different hardware flavours: a +14dBm Tx power version which can only work with RCZ1 and RCZ3 and a +22dBm version which works exclusively on RCZ2 and RCZ4.\n\nsigfox.mac()\n\nReturns a byte object with the 8-Byte MAC address of the Sigfox radio.\nsigfox.id()\n\nReturns a byte object with the 4-Byte bytes object with the Sigfox ID.\nsigfox.rssi()\n\nReturns a signed integer with indicating the signal strength value of the last received packet.\nsigfox.pac()\n\nReturns a byte object with the 8-Byte bytes object with the Sigfox PAC.\nTo return human-readable values you should import binascii and convert binary values to hexidecimal representation. For example:\n\nprint(binascii.hexlify(sigfox.mac()))\n\nsigfox.frequencies()\n\nReturns a tuple of the form: (uplink_frequency_hz,downlink_frequency_hz)\nsigfox.public_key([public])\n\nSets or gets the public key flag.

To receive data, a message must first be sent up to Sigfox, requesting a downlink message. This can be done by passing a True argument into the setsockopt() method.\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, True)\n\nAn example of the downlink procedure can be seen below:\n# init Sigfox for RCZ1 (Europe)\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1)\n\n# create a Sigfox socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(True)\n\n# configure it as DOWNLINK specified by 'True'\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, True)\n\n# send some bytes and request DOWNLINK\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3]))\n\n# await DOWNLINK message\ns.recv(32)\n\nSigfox FSK (Device to Device)\nTo communicate between two Sigfox capable devices, it may be used in FSK mode. Two devices are required to be set to the same frequency, both using FSK.\nDevice 1:\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.FSK, frequency=868000000)\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\ns.setblocking(True)\n\nwhile True:\n  s.send('Device-1')\n  time.sleep(1)\n  print(s.recv(64))\n\nDevice 2:\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.FSK, frequency=868000000)\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\ns.setblocking(True)\n\nwhile True:\n  s.send('Device-2')\n  time.sleep(1)\n  print(s.recv(64))\n\nRemember to use the correct frequency for your region (868 MHz for Europe, 912 MHz for USA, etc.)\n\n"},"chapter/firmwareapi/pycom/aes.html":{"url":"chapter/firmwareapi/pycom/aes.html","title":"6.2.3 AES","keywords":"","body":"class AES - Advanced Encryption Standard\nAES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher standardised by NIST.

The idea behind it is similar to CPython’s ctypes modules, but the actual API is different, streamlined and optimised for small size. The basic idea of the module is to define data structure layout with about the same power as the C language allows, and the access it using familiar dot-syntax to reference sub-fields.\nModule ustruct\nStandard Python way to access binary data structures (doesn’t scale well to large and complex structures).\n\nDefining Structure Layout\nStructure layout is defined by a “descriptor” - a Python dictionary which encodes field names as keys and other properties required to access them as associated values. Currently, uctypes requires explicit specification of offsets for each field. Offset are given in bytes from a structure start.\nFollowing are encoding examples for various field types:\n\nScalar types:\n\n\"field_name\": uctypes.UINT32 | 0\n\nIn other words, value is scalar type identifier OR-ed with field offset (in bytes) from the start of the structure.\n\nRecursive structures:\n\n\"sub\": (2, {\n    \"b0\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0,\n    \"b1\": uctypes.UINT8 | 1,\n})\n\ni.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is offset, and second is a structure descriptor dictionary (note: offsets in recursive descriptors are relative to a structure it defines).\n\nArrays of Primitive Types:\n\n\"arr\": (uctypes.ARRAY | 0, uctypes.UINT8 | 2),\n\ni.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag OR-ed with offset, and second is scalar element type ORed number of elements in array.\n\nArrays of Aggregate Types:\n\n\"arr2\": (uctypes.ARRAY | 0, 2, {\"b\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0}),\n\ni.e. value is a 3-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag OR-ed with offset, second is a number of elements in array, and third is descriptor of element type.\n\nPointer to a primitive type:\n\n\"ptr\": (uctypes.PTR | 0, uctypes.UINT8),\n\ni.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag ORed with offset, and second is scalar element type.\n\nPointer to an aggregate type:\n\n\"ptr2\": (uctypes.PTR | 0, {\"b\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0}),\n\ni.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag ORed with offset, second is descriptor of type pointed to.\n\nBitfields:\n\n\"bitf0\": uctypes.BFUINT16 | 0 | 0 \ni.e. value is type of scalar value containing given bitfield (typenames are similar to scalar types, but prefixes with “BF”), OR-ed with offset for scalar value containing the bitfield, and further OR-ed with values for bit offset and bit length of the bitfield within scalar value, shifted by BF_POS and BF_LEN positions, respectively. Bitfield position is counted from the least significant bit, and is the number of right-most bit of a field (in other words, it’s a number of bits a scalar needs to be shifted right to extra the bitfield).\nIn the example above, first UINT16 value will be extracted at offset 0 (this detail may be important when accessing hardware registers, where particular access size and alignment are required), and then bitfield whose rightmost bit is least-significant bit of this UINT16, and length is 8 bits, will be extracted - effectively, this will access least-significant byte of UINT16.\nNote that bitfield operations are independent of target byte endianness, in particular, example above will access least-significant byte of UINT16 in both little- and big-endian structures. But it depends on the least significant bit being numbered 0. Some targets may use different numbering in their native ABI, but uctypes always uses normalised numbering described above.\nModule Contents\nclass uctypes.struct(addr, descriptor, layout_type=NATIVE)\n\nInstantiate a “foreign data structure” object based on structure address in memory, descriptor (encoded as a dictionary), and layout type (see below).\nuctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN\n\nLayout type for a little-endian packed structure. (Packed means that every field occupies exactly as many bytes as defined in the descriptor, i.e. the alignment is 1).\nuctypes.BIG_ENDIAN\n\nLayout type for a big-endian packed structure.\nuctypes.NATIVE\n\nLayout type for a native structure - with data endianness and alignment conforming to the ABI of the system on which MicroPython runs.\nuctypes.sizeof(struct)\n\nReturn size of data structure in bytes. Argument can be either structure class or specific instantiated structure object (or its aggregate field).\nuctypes.addressof(obj)\n\nReturn address of an object. Argument should be bytes, bytearray or other object supporting buffer protocol (and address of this buffer is what actually returned).\nuctypes.bytes_at(addr, size)\n\nCapture memory at the given address and size as bytes object. As bytes object is immutable, memory is actually duplicated and copied into bytes object, so if memory contents change later, created object retains original value.\nuctypes.bytearray_at(addr, size)\n\nCapture memory at the given address and size as bytearray object. Unlike bytes_at() function above, memory is captured by reference, so it can be both written too, and you will access current value at the given memory address.\nStructure Descriptors and Instantiating Structure Objects\nGiven a structure descriptor dictionary and its layout type, you can instantiate a specific structure instance at a given memory address using uctypes.struct() constructor. Memory address usually comes from following sources:\n\nPredefined address, when accessing hardware registers on a baremetal system. Lookup these addresses in datasheet for a particular MCU/SoC.\nAs a return value from a call to some FFI (Foreign Function Interface) function.\nFrom uctypes.addressof(), when you want to pass arguments to an FFI function, or alternatively, to access some data for I/O (for example, data read from a file or network socket).\n\nStructure objects\nStructure objects allow accessing individual fields using standard dot notation: my_struct.substruct1.field1. If a field is of scalar type, getting it will produce a primitive value (Python integer or float) corresponding to the value contained in a field. A scalar field can also be assigned to.\nIf a field is an array, its individual elements can be accessed with the standard subscript operator [] - both read and assigned to.\nIf a field is a pointer, it can be dereferenced using [0] syntax (corresponding to C * operator, though [0] works in C too). Subscripting a pointer with other integer values but 0 are supported too, with the same semantics as in C.\nSumming up, accessing structure fields generally follows C syntax, except for pointer dereference, when you need to use [0] operator instead of * .\nLimitations\nAccessing non-scalar fields leads to allocation of intermediate objects to represent them. This means that special care should be taken to layout a structure which needs to be accessed when memory allocation is disabled (e.g. from an interrupt). The recommendations are:\n\nAvoid nested structures. For example, instead of mcu_registers.peripheral_a.register1, define separate layout descriptors for each peripheral, to be accessed as peripheral_a.register1.\nAvoid other non-scalar data, like array. For example, instead of peripheral_a.register[0] use peripheral_a.register0.\n\nNote that these recommendations will lead to decreased readability and conciseness of layouts, so they should be used only if the need to access structure fields without allocation is anticipated (it’s even possible to define 2 parallel layouts - one for normal usage, and a restricted one to use when memory allocation is prohibited).\n"},"chapter/firmwareapi/micropython/sys.html":{"url":"chapter/firmwareapi/micropython/sys.html","title":"6.3.3 sys","keywords":"","body":"sys – System Specific Functions\nFunctions\nsys.exit(retval=0)\n\nTerminate current program with a given exit code.

On systems with underlying OS (including some RTOS), an RTC may be implicit. Setting and maintaining actual calendar time is responsibility of OS/RTOS and is done outside of MicroPython, it just uses OS API to query date/time. On baremetal ports however system time depends on machine.RTC() object. The current calendar time may be set using machine.RTC().datetime(tuple) function, and maintained by following means:\n\nBy a backup battery (which may be an additional, optional component for a particular board).\nUsing networked time protocol (requires setup by a port/user).\nSet manually by a user on each power-up (many boards then maintain RTC time across hard resets, though some may require setting it again in such case).\n\nIf actual calendar time is not maintained with a system/MicroPython RTC, functions below which require reference to current absolute time may behave not as expected.\nFunctions\nutime.gmtime([secs])\n\nConvert a time expressed in seconds since the Epoch (see above) into an 8-tuple which contains: (year, month, mday, hour, minute, second, weekday, yearday) If secs is not provided or None, then the current time from the RTC is used.\n\nyear includes the century (for example 2014).\nmonth is 1-12\nmday is 1-31\nhour is 0-23\nminute is 0-59\nsecond is 0-59\nweekday is 0-6 for Mon-Sun\nyearday is 1-366\n\nutime.localtime([secs])\n\nLike gmtime() but converts to local time.

The value returned by these functions may wrap around at any time, so directly subtracting them is not supported. ticks_diff() should be used instead. “old” value should actually precede “new” value in time, or result is undefined. This function should not be used to measure arbitrarily long periods of time (because ticks*() functions wrap around and usually would have short period). The expected usage pattern is implementing event polling with timeout:\n# Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us\nstart = time.ticks_us()\nwhile pin.value() == 0:\n    if time.ticks_diff(start, time.ticks_us()) > 500:\n        raise TimeoutError\n\nutime.time()\n\nReturns the number of seconds, as an integer, since the Epoch, assuming that underlying RTC is set.

There are some notable points regarding the syntax of classes, methods and constants. Please see the notes below and familiarise yourself with the specific details before reviewing the documentation.\nKeyword Arguments\nKeyword Arguments refer to the arguments that are passed into a constructor (upon referencing a class object). When passing values into a MicroPython constructor it is not always required to specify the name of the argument and instead rely on the order of the arguments passed as to describe what they refer to. In the example below, it can be seen that the argument mode is passed into the i2c.init() method without specifying a name.\nThe values of the arguments (as seen in the examples/docs) refer to the default values that are passed into the constructor if nothing is provided.\ni2c.init(mode, * , baudrate=100000, pins=(SDA, SCL))\n\nAn example of how this method might be called:\ni2c.init(I2C.MASTER, pins=('P12', 'P11'))\n\nIt can be seen that a value for baudrate was not passed into the method and thus MicroPython will assume a default value of 100000. Also the first argument mode was not specified by name, as the constructor does not require it, denoted by the lack of an ‘=’ symbol in the constructor documentation.\nPassing Arguments into a Method\nIt is important to note that there are certain class methods that can only accept a keyword for certain arguments as well as some that only accept a value. This is intentional by design but is not always apparent to the user calling specific methods. The differences between the two are outlined below, with examples referencing where differences might apply and what to be aware of.\nKeyword\nAn astrik ‘ * ’ in a method description (in the docs), denotes that the following arguments require a keyword, i.e. pin='P16' in the example below.\nadc.channel(* , pin, attn=ADC.ATTN_0DB)\n\n\nfrom machine import ADC\n\nadc = ADC()                     # create an ADC object\napin = adc.channel(pin='P16')   # create an analog pin on P16\n\npin is a required argument and the method channel will not execute unless it is passed as with a keyword.\nAnother example shows how the PWM class, pwm.channel() requires a keyword argument for pin but does not for id.\nfrom machine import PWM\n\npwm = PWM(0, frequency=5000)\npwm_c = pwm.channel(0, pin='P12') # no keyword argument requires for id (0) but is required for pin (pin='P12')\n\nValue\nThe documentation may refer to a method that takes an argument listed by name but does allow for a keyword to be passed. For example, the pycom class contains a method rgbled. This lists that the method accepts a value for color, however this may not be specified by keyword, only value. This is intentional as the value being passed is the only argument valid for this method\npycom.rgbled(color)\n\nIf the argument is passed into the method with a keyword, it will return an error stating TypeError: function does not take keyword arguments.\nimport pycom\n\npycom.rgbled(color=0xFF0000) # Incorrect\npycom.rgbled(0xFF0000) # Correct\n\nAnother example of a method that only accepts value input. In this case, the RTC.init() method require a value (tuple) input for the datetime. It will not accept a keyword.\nrtc.init(datetime)\n\n\nfrom machine import RTC\n\nrtc = RTC()\nrtc.init(datetime=(2014, 5, 1, 4, 13, 0, 0, 0)) # Incorrect\nrtc.init((2014, 5, 1, 4, 13, 0, 0, 0)) # Correct\n\nConstants\nThe constants section of a library within the docs refers to specific values from that library’s class. These might be used when constructing an object from that class or when utilising a method from within that class. These are generally listed by the library name followed by the specific value. See the example below:\nI2C.MASTER()\n\nBe aware that you can only reference these constants upon importing and constructing a object from a library.\n\n"},"chapter/docnotes/replscript.html":{"url":"chapter/docnotes/replscript.html","title":"8.3 REPL vs Scripts","keywords":"","body":"REPL vs Scripts\nUsers of this documentation should be aware that examples given in the docs are under the expection that they are being executed using the MicroPython REPL.

When using the REPL many classes/functions automatically produce a printed output displaying the return value of the function to the console. The code snippet below demonstrates some examples of classes/functions that might display this behaviour.\nBasic Arithmetic\n1 + 1 # REPL will print out '2' to console\n1 + 1 # Script will not return anything the console\nprint(1 + 1) # Both the REPL and a script will return '2' to the console\n\nCalling Methods\nimport binascii\n\nbinascii.hexlify(b'12345') # REPL will print out \"b'3132333435'\" to the console\nbinascii.hexlify(b'12345') # Script will not return any the console\n\nIn order to use these functions that do not print out any values, you will need to either wrap them in a print() statement or assign them to variables and call them later when you wish to use them.\nFor example:\n# immediately print to console when using a script\nprint(1 + 1)\n# or save variable to for later\nvalue = 1 + 1\n# do something here...\nprint(value)\n\n"},"chapter/license/":{"url":"chapter/license/","title":"9.1 License","keywords":"","body":"MicroPython License Information\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 Damien P.
